            <p className='py-5'>Hi there! I’m Simav Adnan Mohamed – a <span className='text-hoverColor font-bold '>Front-End Developer </span>with an unusual passion for making websites beautiful, fast, and smart... kind of like me!

                I hold a degree in Computer and Automation Engineering, and I've worked on a variety of projects including student management systems, educational platforms, and custom admin dashboards (yes, they have both dark and light modes 😎).</p>
            <div className='pb-5'>
                <h1 className='text-xl text-hoverColor'>  My toolbox includes:</h1>

                <p> React, Tailwind, Material UI</p>
                <p>  PHP, MySQL, and PDO</p>
                <p className=' gradient inline'>And sometimes I speak fluent JSON (though not everyone understands me</p>😅)
            </div>
            <p>I believe every button should have a purpose, and every animation should delight the user (<span className='font-mono'>not dizzy them</span>).</p>
            <p>I love challenges, learn quickly, and most importantly: I don’t settle for “just okay.” It’s either polished... or not published.</p> 

            I'm currently seeking a chance to join a professional team where I can contribute my ideas, passion, and maybe annoy people a little with my curiosity (but they’ll love me eventually 💻❤️).
